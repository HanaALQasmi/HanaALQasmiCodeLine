1. Open a PHP extension page
2. Solve the first question: 
- Create a function with the same name as the question part for ease of reference later. Inside the function, declare variables and use them when the function is called with the given arguments.
- Create two loops that are related. The first is for printing the required content entered by the user and then decrementing it. The second loop prints the content according to the number of times it appears in the first loop.
- Output the required format (*) based on the requirements of the two loops and then add a space.

3.Solve the second question.
- Create a function with the same name as the part of the question for easy reference later. Inside the function, there are two calls that are made when the function is called. These calls are passed when the function is called.
- Create a variable for the user to enter the number of elements they need, which is equal to the first call in the function. Then the user enters the steps, which are the second call, and then create a variable for the arithmetic operation according to the question. Finally, request the variable for the arithmetic operation.

  4."Answer the third question.
  - Create a function with the same name as the question part for easy reference later, then use code to display requirements.

  5.Then use a while loop to display the options that the user selects correctly in case he/she does not select anything and presses enter.
  
  6.Then use the switch/case. This is in case the user chooses one of the options, the option appears and enter each case function with its inputs and outputs. Also, case 4 is the last question that the user is asked. Default is in case the user does not choose an option.
